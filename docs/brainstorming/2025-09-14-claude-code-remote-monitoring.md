# Brainstorming Session: Claude Code Remote Monitoring System
*Date: 2025-09-14*
*Facilitator: Claude Code AI*
*Session Type: Feature Planning & Architecture Discovery*

## üéØ Feature Overview

**Goal**: Create a server-Android app system to remotely monitor Claude Code sessions running on a local server, providing real-time visibility into development sessions while mobile.

**Core Problem**: Users initiate long-running Claude Code development tasks, step away from their workstation, and need remote visibility to ensure work progresses smoothly without requiring physical presence.

## üë§ User Scenarios & Requirements

### Primary Use Case
- **Scenario**: User gives Claude Code a complex, multi-hour coding task and leaves their workstation
- **Need**: Monitor session progress remotely via Android device
- **Goal**: Peace of mind that development work continues without issues

### User Requirements
1. **Real-time Stream Access**: See exactly what Claude Code outputs on the local session
2. **Session State Detection**: Distinguish between "Claude working" vs "waiting for input"
3. **Multi-Session Support**: Select which Claude Code session to monitor when multiple are running
4. **Network Flexibility**: Work on both LAN (local network) and remote internet connections
5. **Resilient Connectivity**: Handle mobile network changes and reconnection gracefully
6. **Non-intrusive**: Android app connection/disconnection must not disturb Claude Code sessions

### Session Characteristics
- **Duration**: Multi-hour marathon coding sessions
- **Connectivity**: Intermittent mobile connectivity (WiFi, cellular, network handoffs)
- **Multiple Sessions**: User may run Claude Code on different projects simultaneously

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Data Source Discovery
**Claude Code Session Storage**: `~/.claude/projects/<project-path>/<session-uuid>.jsonl`

**JSONL Structure Analysis**:
```json
{
  "parentUuid": "uuid-of-previous-message",
  "sessionId": "bfe8e7e9-0de4-4dd8-ac92-f24eb31a009b",
  "type": "user|assistant",
  "message": { "role": "user|assistant", "content": "..." },
  "timestamp": "2025-09-14T15:04:35.357Z",
  "cwd": "/project/path"
}
```

**Key Technical Insights**:
- Each line represents one message exchange
- `type:"user"` = Claude waiting for input
- `type:"assistant"` = Claude actively working
- Timestamps enable activity detection
- Session UUID provides unique identification
- Project path embedded in directory structure

### System Components

#### 1. Standalone Server (Local Machine)
**Core Responsibilities**:
- Monitor `~/.claude/projects/` directory structure
- Detect active Claude Code sessions via JSONL file activity
- Tail JSONL files for real-time message streaming
- Provide HTTP/WebSocket API for Android client
- Handle session state detection and metadata

**Technical Approach**:
- **Session Discovery**: Directory scanning + file modification monitoring
- **Real-time Streaming**: File tailing (inotify/fsevents) + JSONL parsing
- **State Management**: Track "working" vs "waiting" states per session
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints + WebSocket streams
- **Network Architecture**: Support both LAN discovery and remote access

#### 2. Android Application
**Core Features**:
- Session selection interface (list available Claude Code sessions)
- Real-time stream viewer displaying Claude's output
- Session state indicators (working/waiting/idle)
- Connection management with reconnection logic
- Historical message buffer for catch-up after disconnection

**UI Components**:
- Session list with project names and activity status
- Stream viewer with timestamp display
- Connection status indicator
- Session switching capability

#### 3. Network & Communication
**Local Network (LAN)**:
- Server discovery via mDNS/Bonjour
- Direct HTTP/WebSocket connection
- Low latency, high reliability

**Remote Network (Internet)**:
- Secure authentication mechanism
- HTTPS/WSS encrypted connections
- Potential NAT traversal or VPN requirements

## üìä Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Monitoring (MVP)
**Scope**: Read-only monitoring with session selection
- [x] JSONL file monitoring and parsing
- [x] Session discovery and listing
- [x] Real-time stream extraction
- [x] Basic Android viewer app
- [x] Local network connectivity

**Success Criteria**:
- User can see list of active Claude Code sessions
- User can select and view real-time output stream
- System works reliably on local network

### Phase 2: Enhanced Connectivity
**Scope**: Robust networking and mobile optimization
- [ ] Remote internet access with authentication
- [ ] Connection resilience and automatic reconnection
- [ ] Session history buffering for disconnection recovery
- [ ] Mobile network optimization

### Phase 3: Interactive Capabilities
**Scope**: Two-way communication (Future Enhancement)
- [ ] Send prompts when Claude Code is waiting for input
- [ ] Session control (interrupt, cancel operations)
- [ ] File upload capability to sessions

## üîí Security & Architecture Considerations

### Security Requirements
- **Local Network**: Minimal authentication (simple token/password)
- **Remote Access**: Strong authentication mechanism required
- **Data Privacy**: Ensure session data remains secure during transmission
- **Access Control**: Session-level permissions and user isolation

### Technical Constraints
- **Non-intrusive Design**: Monitoring must not affect Claude Code performance
- **Resource Efficiency**: Minimal overhead on development machine
- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Server should work across different OS environments
- **Scalability**: Support multiple concurrent Android clients per session

### Risk Mitigation
- **Connection Failures**: Implement robust reconnection logic with exponential backoff
- **Session State Sync**: Handle race conditions between file updates and network transmission
- **Mobile Battery**: Optimize for mobile device battery consumption
- **Data Volume**: Implement intelligent streaming to manage bandwidth usage

## üìù Technical Implementation Notes

### JSONL Monitoring Strategy
- **File Watching**: Use filesystem events (inotify/fsevents) for real-time detection
- **Parsing Logic**: Stream-based JSONL parsing to handle large session files
- **State Detection**: Analyze message flow to determine Claude's current state
- **Session Activity**: Use timestamp analysis to detect active vs idle sessions

### Android Application Architecture
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket connection for live streaming
- **Offline Capability**: Local caching for historical messages
- **UI Responsiveness**: Background threading for network operations
- **Session Management**: Persistent session preferences and connection history

### Server API Design
```
GET /api/sessions - List available Claude Code sessions
GET /api/sessions/{id} - Get session metadata
WebSocket /ws/sessions/{id} - Stream session messages
GET /api/sessions/{id}/history - Get historical messages
```
