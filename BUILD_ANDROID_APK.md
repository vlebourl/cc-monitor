## APK File Locations

After successful build, find your APK here:

### Debug APK (For Testing)
```
android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```
- **Size**: ~15-25 MB
- **Features**: Includes debugging symbols
- **Performance**: Slower, larger file

### Release APK (For Distribution)
```
android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release-unsigned.apk
```
- **Size**: ~8-15 MB
- **Features**: Optimized, minified
- **Performance**: Faster, smaller file

## First Time Setup on Phone

After installing the APK:

1. **Open "Claude Code Monitor" app**
2. **Grant permissions** when prompted:
   - Camera (for QR scanning)
   - Storage (for message caching)
3. **Start your Claude Code server** on your computer
4. **Scan QR code** from server dashboard
5. **Begin monitoring** your Claude Code sessions!

## Automated Build Script

For convenience, here's a build script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# save as build-apk.sh
echo "Building Claude Code Monitor APK..."
cd android
./gradlew clean
./gradlew assembleRelease
echo "âœ… APK built successfully!"
echo "ðŸ“± Location: android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release-unsigned.apk"
```

Make executable and run:
```bash
chmod +x build-apk.sh
./build-apk.sh
```

## Development Notes

- **Debug APK**: Good for testing and development
- **Release APK**: Optimized for production use
- **Bundle (AAB)**: For Google Play Store (not needed for direct install)
- **Signed APK**: Required for Play Store (we're using unsigned for direct install)

## Security Note

The APK generated is unsigned and intended for development/personal use. For production distribution, you would need to sign the APK with a keystore.
